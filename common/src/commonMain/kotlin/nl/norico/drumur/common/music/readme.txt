A song has multiple parts, eg drums, bass, lead
The parts play at the same time

Each part consists of bars, so a song also consists of bars
The number of bars is the same across all parts and the song

A bar can have different variations, called patterns
For each part, you can select the order of the patterns, and they can be repeated

Each part consists of multiple tracks, melodic or not
On each position in a bar, a tracks can trigger a sound or not
In the future possibly stopped by the following note or stop events, now it stops after a set time
The sound of the track can be changed while keeping the triggers
